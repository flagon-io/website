            <p>
              Flagon started with a frustration. Most software companies operate
              behind a curtain: the handbook is internal, the roadmap is a sales
              tool, and the real reasoning for anything lives in a few
              people&rsquo;s heads. Then they spend a fortune convincing you to
              trust them anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&rsquo;d worked at places like that, and it made the work worse. So I
              started Flagon to do it the other way around: build the company out
              loud, from the first day, and let people read exactly how it runs
              before deciding to trust it. A few months in, I&rsquo;m more sure of
              that call than almost any other. The whole story lives in the{" "}

              Fair warning: if you like the way most companies treat you, you might
              not like us. We&rsquo;re building the company we&rsquo;ve always wanted
              to work for, which means quietly rejecting a pile of things that
              somehow became normal. No spin, no fog, no growth tricks that only
              work because you weren&rsquo;t paying attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              The whole thing comes down to one rule: we try to treat you the way
              we&rsquo;d want to be treated. If a tactic gives us the ick, it gives
              you the ick too, so we don&rsquo;t use it. We&rsquo;re also not for
              everyone, and we&rsquo;d rather say so plainly than pretend otherwise.

              This isn&rsquo;t a bait-and-switch or a plan to exit in a few years.
              Flagon is meant to be a durable company, run default-alive, making
              useful software in public for as long as it&rsquo;s worth doing.
              It&rsquo;s the work I want to be doing, at the company I&rsquo;d want
              to buy software from and want to work at.

            <p>
              We&rsquo;re small and early, and we&rsquo;re not going to pretend
              otherwise. But the direction is fixed, and it won&rsquo;t change with
              the fundraising weather: build good things, in the open, for the long
